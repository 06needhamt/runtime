* Ideas

	Here are a few ideas of tools, classes and projects that you
	could start. More are forthcoming.

** Classes

	<ul>
		* Implement a JXTA protocol implementation:
		<a href="http://www.jxta.org">http://www.jxta.org</a>

		* Implement a Mail API, similar to Camel or JavaMail (Camel has
		  significant architecture features that are required on a real
		  mailer).

		  You can check the current C 
		<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?dir=evolution%2Fcamel">
		Camel implementation</a>.

		* Interfacing to Multimedia systems.  You might want
		  to look into the Quicktime API.  I know <a
		  href="mailto:vladimir@ximian.com">Vladimir</a> has
		  researched the problem before 
	</ul>

** Projects

	<ul>
		* Implement an xmlStorageSystem for the CLI:
		<a href="http://www.soapware.org/xmlStorageSystem">
		http://www.soapware.org/xmlStorageSystem</a>

		* Build a CORBA interoperability engine for the CLR.
		  You do not need to do all of the work, just talking
		  the protocol will get us a long way (<a
		  href="http://www.omg.org">The OMG site</a> has the CORBA specs).

	</ul>
