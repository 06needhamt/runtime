* Software Availability

	The Virtual Execution System is available in package `mono'.
	Currently this contains a metadata library and the
	disassembler.  Please reffer to our <a
	href="runtime.html">Runtime</a> description for more details
	on this part of the project.

	The code for the C# compiler as well as the language error
	test suite and the class library are in the `mcs' package, we
	will move this later into `mono' itself. 

	The mcs compiler requires the `jay' parser generator, this is
	available in module `jay'.
