* Contributing to the Mono project

	There are many ways in which you can help in the Mono project:

	<ul>
		* <b>Programmers:</b> You can work on a free
		  implementation of the <a
		  href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>, the
		  <a href="runtime.html">runtime engine</a>, <a
		  href="tools.html">the tools</a>, the <a
		  href="testing.html">testing framework</a>

		* <b>Writers:</b> You can help us with writing <a
		  href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.
	</ul>

	Those are just broad things that need to be worked on, but
	something that would help tremendously would be to help with
	small duties in the project that need to be addressed. 

** Small tasks

	A few smaller tasks are here, dropped in no particular order:
	<ul>
		* <b>MCS compilation process:</b> Currently MCS does
		  not build with a single `make' command.  This should
		  be fixed (this being part of the `Joel Test' that
		  software has to pass).

		* <b>Mono/doc and web site:</b> They need to be
		  packaged up in the official `distribution'
	</ul>

* Special note

	If you have looked at Microsoft's implementation of .NET or
	their shared source code, you will not be able to contribute
	to Mono.

	Please, follow care when reading proprietary code.
