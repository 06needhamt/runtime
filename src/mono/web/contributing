* Contributing to the Mono project

	There are many ways in which you can help in the Mono project:

	<ul>
		* <b>Programmers:</b> You can work on a free
		  implementation of the <a
		  href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>, the
		  <a href="runtime.html">runtime engine</a>, <a
		  href="tools.html">the tools</a>, the <a
		  href="testing.html">testing framework</a>

		* <b>Writers:</b> You can help us bywriting <a
		  href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.
	</ul>

	Those are just broad things that need to be worked on, but
	something that would help tremendously would be to help with
	small duties in the project that need to be addressed. 

** To start contributing

	To start developing classes or to contribute to the compiler,
	you only need Windows and the .NET Framework 1.0 SDK.  Please notice
	that you do not need Visual Studio (although you can use it if
	you want).  

	You can get it <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true">here</a>

	If you are new to .NET, writing regression tests is a good way
	of starting to contribute: it will help you get used to C# as
	well as getting comfortable with the .NET APIs.  

	This helps because at this point you might be the best
	qualified person to fix a problem found by the regression
	test, or you might have a new class to implement in the .NET
	world that only has a test suite.

** Bug reporting

	If you find bugs in Mono, please make sure you enter a bug
	report so we can keep track of problems in Mono.

	To enter bug reports go to <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">
	http://bugzilla.ximian.com</a> and enter bug reports against
	your favorite component (Mono, Runtime, C# compiler).

** Small tasks

	A few smaller tasks are here, dropped in no particular order:
	<ul>
		* <b>Mono/doc and web site:</b> They need to be
		  packaged up in the official `distribution'

		* Adding serialization support to all the classes.

		  We have many classes, but we have not implemented in
		  many cases the serialization and re-incarnation support in 
		  them (this is pretty straight forward code, and simple,
	  	  but there is a lot to be done here).
	</ul>

* Emacs support

	Brad Merryl's C# mode for Emacs is available: <a
	href="http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs/">http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs/</a>

* Books on C# and DotNet.

	<ul>
	* Dotnet Books (<a href="http://www.dotnetbooks.com">http://www.dotnetbooks.com</a>)

	* Dotnet Resources (<a href="http://www.dotnetexperts.com/resources/">
	  http://www.dotnetexperts.com/resources</a>)

	* O'Reilly C# Essentials (<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpess/">
	  http://www.oreally.com/catalog/csharpess</a>)

	* O'Really .NET Essentials (<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dotnetfrmess/">
	  http://www.oreally.com/catalog/dotnetfrmess</a>)
	</ul>

* Special note

	If you have looked at Microsoft's implementation of .NET or
	their shared source code, you may not be able to contribute
	to Mono.  Details will follow when we know more about this.

	In general be careful when you are implementing free software
	and you have access to proprietary code.  We need to make sure
	that we are not using someone else's copyrighted code
	accidentally. 

	Please do not use the <b>ildasm</b> program to disassemble
	proprietary code when you are planning to reimplement a class
	for Mono.  If you have done this, we might not be able to use
	your code.

	Please stick to published documentation for implementing any
	classes.
