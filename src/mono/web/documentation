* Documentation

	A project like Mono will require a lot of documentation to be
	written.  Although most of the concepts from Microsoft.NET can
	be applied to the Mono platform once finished, we do need to
	have a complete set of free documentation written for it.

	The documentation license we have chosen is the FSF FDL which
	is the standard for most documents on the free software
	world. 

	We need documentation to be written on a number of topics:

		* The development tools (compilers, assembler tools,
		  language reference, design time features).

		* Freely redistributable Frequently Asked Question
		  compilations.

		* Freely redistributable HOWTO documents.

		* The Class Libraries

		* Tutorials on Mono and the specifics of running it
		  compared to the Microsoft.NET Framework SDK

		* Differences between the Microsoft.NET Framework SDK
		  development mode and the Mono version.

** Class Library documentation

	When contributing to the Class Library effort, please use the
	inline XML documentation tags to document your classes so we
	can automatically generate the documentation from the class
	libraries. 

	If you provide examples, please do not embed them into the
	source code, as that will make the source code harder to read
	and maintain.  Instead put examples for your code into a
	subdirectory of the class libraries.  Also make that sample
	code a full standalone application that people can compile
	(ideally our documentation browser could let you edit, modify
	and run the sample programs, as Tcl/Tk used to let you do in
	the past).
