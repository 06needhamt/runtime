* Documentation

	Although most of the concepts from Microsoft.NET can
	be applied to the completed Mono platform, we do need to
	have a complete set of free documentation written specifically
	for Mono.

	The documentation license we have chosen is the GNU Free
	Documentation License (FDL), the standard for most documents
	in the free software world. 

	We need documentation on a number of topics:

	<ul>

		* The development tools (compilers, assembler tools,
		  language reference, design time features).

		* Frequently Asked Question compilations.

		* HOWTO documents.

		* The Class Libraries

		* Tutorials on Mono and the specifics of running it. 

		* A guide to Mono as compared to the Microsoft.NET
		  Framework SDK

	</ul>

** Class Library documentation

	When contributing to the Class Library effort, please use the
	inline XML documentation tags to document your classes so we
	can automatically generate the documentation from the class
	libraries. 

	If you provide examples, please do not embed them into the
	source code, as that will make the source code harder to read
	and maintain.  Instead, put examples for your code into a
	subdirectory of the class libraries. Make your sample
	code a full standalone application that people can compile.
	Ideally the Mono documentation browser will let you edit, modify
	and run the sample programs.
