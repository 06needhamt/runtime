* Documentation

	Although most of the concepts from Microsoft.NET can
	be applied to the completed Mono platform, we do need to
	have a complete set of free documentation written specifically
	for Mono.

	The documentation license we have chosen is the GNU Free
	Documentation License (FDL), the standard for most documents
	in the free software world. 

	We need documentation on a number of topics:

	<ul>

		* The development tools (compilers, assembler tools,
		  language reference, design time features).

		* Frequently Asked Question compilations.

		* HOWTO documents.

		* The Class Libraries

		* Tutorials on Mono and the specifics of running it. 

		* A guide to Mono as compared to the Microsoft.NET
		  Framework SDK

	</ul>

** Class Library documentation

	We are moving to a new setup for documenting the class libraries, 
	and you can read about it <a href="classlib-doc.html">here</a>.

        A few words of warning and advice for class documentors:

        A well-documented API can ease hours of frustration; as Mono
        matures, robust and complete class library documentation will
        become increasingly important.  As you write API documentation,
        whether it is embedded in source files or in external Monodoc XML,
        please keep the following in mind:

        Plagarism, even if it's unintentional, is a Bad Thing(TM).
        Microsoft's .NET Framework Class Library documentation is an
        excellent resource for understanding the behavior and properties of
        a type, and a lot of hard work went in to creating this (copyrighted)
        resource.  Please don't copy from Microsoft's reference when
        documenting a type.

        To avoid this, I (<a href="mailto:jbarn@httcb.net">jbarn@httcb.net</a>)
        suggest that you read the complete Microsoft documentation for a type,
        ponder it for a while, and write the Mono documentation in your own
        words.  While it's certainly okay to refer to the Microsoft
        documentation to clarify your understanding of behavior or properties,
        please don't open the Microsoft docs and refer to them for each member
        you document.

        There's a lot of domain expertise among the class library contributors;
        let's put the same personal stamp on the class library documentation
        that we have on the class libraries themselves.
