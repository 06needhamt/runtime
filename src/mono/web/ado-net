* ADO.NET

	The coordinator for the ADO.NET implementation is <a
	href="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">Rodrigo Moya</a>, with
	the collaboration of <a href="mailto:danmorg@sc.rr.com">Daniel
	Morgan</a>.

* Action plan

	The current plan to implement ADO.NET is as follows:

	<b>Step 1:</b> SqlClient:

	<ul>
		* Implementation of System.Data.SqlClient based on
		  the PostgreSQL C API.

		* Once the System.Data.SqlClient code is functional and
		  is usable by other people, we willl move it to
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL, and will convert the existing
		  System.Data.SqlClient to be just a wrapper around
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL.  

	</ul>

	<b>Step 2:</b> OleDB:
	<ul>
		* On Unix systems: System.Data.OleDb will use LibGDA as its
		  engine. 

		  LibGDA is the data access engine that is used by
		  Gnome-Db (only libgda, not libgnomedb at all).

		* On Windows systems: System.Data.OleDb will use OLE-DB as
		  its engine.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 3:</b> System.Data.SqlClient Providers:

	<ul>
		* System.Data.SqlClient will then become a generic
		  proxy for binding to other SQL implementations other
		  than PostgreSQL (MySQL on Unix/Windows; MS SQL on
		  Window; Interbase on Unix/Windows). Others are welcomed.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 4:</b> Other System.Data providers:

	<ul>
		* The idea in MS .NET System.Data seems to be to have
		  a managed provider for each supported DBMS. So, apart
		  from System.Data.OleDb (generic) and System.Data.SqlClient,
		  we'll need to have System.Data.ODBC, System.Data.MySQL,
		  System.Data.Oracle, System.Data.PostgreSQL, etc. Others,
		  of course, are welcomed.
	</ul>
	
* Current Status

	We are able now to run basic commands (INSERT, DELETE) into a
	PostgreSQL database (see mcs/class/System.Data/Test/TestSqlInsert.cs).
	To compile that test program, you need:

	<b>On Linux</b>

	<ul>
		* update your mono sources.

		* get the .dll's and mcs.exe built on windows, and put them on your
		  linux machine.

		* compile the test program along with the System.Data.Common and
		  System.Data.SqlClient files.
	</ul>
