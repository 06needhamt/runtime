* ADO.NET

	The coordinator for the ADO.NET implementation is <a
	href="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">Rodrigo Moya</a>, with
	the collaboration of <a href="mailto:danmorg@sc.rr.com">Daniel
	Morgan</a>.

* Action plan

	The current plan to implement ADO.NET is as follows:

	<b>Step 1:</b> SqlClient:

	<ul>
		* Implementation of System.Data.SqlClient based on
		  the PostgreSQL C API.

		* Once the System.Data.SqlClient code is functional and
		  is usable by other people, we willl move it to
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL, and will convert the existing
		  System.Data.SqlClient to be just a wrapper around
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL.  

	</ul>

	<b>Step 2:</b> OleDB:
	<ul>
		* On Unix systems: System.Data.OleDb will use LibGDA as its
		  engine. 

		  LibGDA is the data access engine that is used by
		  Gnome-Db (only libgda, not libgnomedb at all).

		* On Windows systems: System.Data.OleDb will use OLE-DB as
		  its engine.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 3:</b> System.Data.SqlClient Providers:

	<ul>
		* System.Data.SqlClient will then become a generic
		  proxy for binding to other SQL implementations other
		  than PostgreSQL (MySQL on Unix/Windows; MS SQL on
		  Window; Interbase on Unix/Windows). Others are welcomed.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 4:</b> Other System.Data providers:

	<ul>
		* The idea in MS .NET System.Data seems to be to have
		  a managed provider for each supported DBMS. So, apart
		  from System.Data.OleDb (generic) and System.Data.SqlClient,
		  we'll need to have System.Data.ODBC, System.Data.MySQL,
		  System.Data.Oracle, System.Data.PostgreSQL, etc. Others,
		  of course, are welcomed.
	</ul>
	
* Current Status

	We are able now to run basic commands (INSERT, DELETE) into a
	PostgreSQL database (see mcs/class/System.Data/Test/TestSqlInsert.cs).
	To compile that test program, you need:

	<b>On Linux</b>

	<ul>
		* update your mono sources.

		* get the .dll's and mcs.exe built on windows, and put them on your
		  linux machine.

		* compile the test program along with the System.Data.Common and
		  System.Data.SqlClient files.
	</ul>

* Testing

	In order to test System.Data.SqlClient, you will need to have
	access to a remote PostgreSQL DBMS, or you will have to install 
	one locally.  PostgreSQL is the DBMS used for the initial 
	implementation of System.Data.SqlClient.
	
	Why?  Because it is open source, has a client 
	library that is easy to use, PostgreSQL is easy to install 
	using the Cygwin install program, not difficult to setup after
	installation, and it runs under: Linux, 
	Windows (via cygwin and ipc-daemon), Unix, and
	others.  This allowed us to create the
	System.Data functionality in Mono much quicker.
	
	If you plan on using a remote PostgreSQL DBMS Server,
	than you will need to have the PostgreSQL client software on your
	local computer that includes libpq.so (pq.dll on Windows).

	Installation instructions for PostgreSQL DBMS:

	<b>On Linux</b>

	<ul>
		* TODO

		* It easier to install PostgreSQL on Linux than Windows.  
	</ul>

	<b>On Windows</b>

	<ul>
		* Use the cygwin installer to install the PostgreSQL DBMS.  It is
		  found in the database category.
		  
		* Read the file postgres-x.x.README at /usr/doc/Cygwin and read 
		  the requirements to install PostgreSQL.  Those requirements
		  are included with cygwin except cygipc.  A default installtion
		  of cygwin does not install everything you will need, so on the 
		  safe side, just include everything when installing cygwin.
		
		  The -x.x in postgres-x.x is the version of your PostgreSQL DBMS.
		
		* Once cygwin has installed PostgreSQL on your computer,
		  read the file FAQ_MSWIN which is available 
		  in /usr/doc/postgres-x.x\FAQ_MSWIN
		  
		  The -x.x in postgres-x.x is the version of your PostgreSQL DBMS.
		  
		  Important notes from this file are:
		  
			* Point 2. - Install the latest cygipc package, 
			  available at
			  http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/V1.1/cygipc/
			  
			  The cygipc package contains the ipc-daemon you will need 
			  to run before you can
			  run the PostgreSQL DBMS Server daemon (postmaster) or run
			  initdb which initializes the PostgreSQL database.
			  
			* Point 3.  The Cygwin bin directory has to be placed in 
			  the path before the Windows program directories, 
			  for example, C:\cygwin\bin 
			  
			  My own note, in the Windows control panel, I set
			  the environment variables PATH to my cygwin /usr/local/bin,
			  /usr/bin, and /bin.  I also set my LD_LIBRARY_PATH to 
			  /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib.  For example:
			  
			  PATH=c:\cygwin\usr\local\bin;c:\cygwin\usr\bin;c:\cygwin\bin;
			  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\cygwin\usr\local\lib;c:\cygwin\usr\lib;
			  
			* Point 4. Start the ipc-daemon that came with the cygipc package.  There
			  are two ways to do this: run it from the command line as:
				ipc-daemon &
				
			  or you can set it up as a Windows service.  See the 
			  file cygrunsrv.README at /usr/doc/Cygwin on how to do this.  Note the
			  troubleshooting section at the end of the cygrunsrv.README file.
			  
		* Read the installation.html file 
		  at /usr/doc/postgresql-x.x/html/installation.html
		
		  In this file, you will run the following commands:
		  
			* mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
			* initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
			* postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &
			* createdb test
			* psql test  		
			  
		  When you need to connect to the database, 
		  you will need ipc-daemon and postmaster running.  Start ipc-daemon
		  before any of the command above.  
		  
		  psql is a command-line PostgreSQL client tool to 
		  enter and run SQL commands and queries.
		  
		  If there is no database user named postgres, create a user named
		  postgres with the following SQL command in the client tool psql:
			plsql test
			create user postgres with password 'fun2db';
		  The only reason I say this is so you can easily use the System.Data tests
		  without having to change the database, userid, etc.
		  
	</ul>
	
	In the path mcs/class/System.Data/Test
	there is a PostgreSQL test program named
	PostgreTest.cs.  Thanks goes to Gonzalo for creating the original
	PostgreSQL test.
	To use it to test System.Data, you
	modify the file to your PostgreSQL database
	connection requirements:
	
	dbname is the database, ie, test
	host is the hostname of the PostgreSQL DBMS Server to connect to
	user is the username, ie, someuser
	password is the password, ie, mypass1234
	
	The connection string is in OLE-DB connection string format.  Internally,
	SqlConnection converts this to the PostgreSQL connection string format.
	
	    OLE-DB: "host=localhost;dbname=test;user=joe;password=smoe"
	PostgreSQL: "host=localhost dbname=test user=joe password=smoe"

	Note that OLE-DB includes the semicolons while PostgreSQL's connection
	string does not.

    To compile the PostgresTest.cs program, do:
    mcs PostgresTest.cs -r System.Data
    
    To run using mint, do:
    mint PostgresTest.exe
    
    To run using mono, do:
    mono PostgresTest.exe
    
    You should get something like:
    
Administrator@DANPC ~/mono/mcs/class/System.Data/Test
$ mcs PostgresTest.cs -r System.Data

Administrator@DANPC ~/mono/mcs/class/System.Data/Test
$ mint PostgresTest.exe
