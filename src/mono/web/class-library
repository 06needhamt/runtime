* The Class Library

	The Class Library should be compatible with Microsoft's .NET
	implementation.

	We will write as much code as possible in C#. We may need to
	interface with code written in C to gain access to the
	functionality of
        libraries like libart, Gtk+, and libc.

** Layout

	The Class Library resides in the `mcs' module in the directoy
	`class'.
	
	Each directory in the directory represents the assembly where
	the code belongs to, and inside each directory we divide the
	code based on the namespace they implement.

	There are two cases when we should consider portability: when
	we are dealing with a couple of classes only that differ from
	system to system (Consider System.Net and System.IO for Win32
	and Unix).  In those cases we will just place the files for
	example on <t>corlib/System/System.IO/Unix-Console.cs</t> and
	<t>corlib/System/System.IO/Win32-Console.cs</t>.

	For classes that might differ more (for example, the
	implementation of Windows.Forms), we might have different
	directories altogether: <t>System.Windows.Forms/Win32</t>,
	<t>System.Windows.Forms/Gtk+</t> and
	<t>System.Windows.Forms/Cocoa</t>.

** Using existing components from GNOME.

	Our current plan is to implement the GUI tools on top of
	Gtk+.  The only obstacle here is that applications from Windows
	might expect to be able to pull the HWND property from the
	widgets and use PInvoke to call Windows functions.

** Class Library and Win32 dependencies.

	There are a few spots where the Win32 foundation is exposed to
	the class library (for example, the HDC and HWND properties in
	the GDI+). Casual inspection suggests that these can be
	safely mapped to Gdk's GC and GdkWindow pointers without
	breaking anything.

	The only drawback is that support for PInvoke of Win32 code
	won't be available.  An alternate solution would be to use
	portions of Wine, or even to use Wine as our toolkit.

*** Initial GDI+ and WinForms implementation

	The initial implementation will use Gtk+ as the underlying
 	toolkit. Since GTK+ has already been ported to many windowing
	systems other than X (including frame buffer, Win32, and BeOS)
	its use should cover most applications for most users. 
	
*** Database access

	We will implement ADO.NET functionality by reusing <a
	href="http://www.gnome-db.org">GNOME-DB</a>. This is an ideal
	choice, since GNOME-DB was implemented precisely to provide an
	ADO-like system for GNOME.

*** Component Integration

	We will provide a new namespace to use GNOME specific features
	as well as a namespace to host Bonobo interfaces and classes
	in Mono.  

** Licensing

	The class library will be licensed under the terms of the GNU
	LGPL.

	We suggest that you assign the copyright of your work to the
	GNOME Foundation or the Free Software Foundation to simplify
	defending the code in case it is used inappropiately. 

** Class Library testing

	We need to write regression tests that will verify
	the correctness of the class library, compiler, and JIT
	engine.

** Contributing

	We welcome contributions to the the Class Library.  To get
	started, check the status page for information about which
	APIs are being worked on, and how to get in touch with 
	individual maintainers.
