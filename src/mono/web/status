* Project Status


	Pieces of Mono that have been implemented:

	<ul>
		* C# compiler: The C# parser can now generate parse
		trees. Next up: semantic analysis, compiler lever optimizations
		and code generation.

		* Metadata library: Can currently parse and load
		information from .NET modules (executables and DLL
		files).  

		Parsing of Exception tables is missing. 

		* Disassembler: Can disassemble .NET modules. Still
		lacking exception handling as well as useful debugging
		tools (hex dumping, token dumping).

		* Class Libraries: You can check the current status in the
		  <a href="class-status.html">Class Status page</a>
	</ul>

	Tasks on the critical path:

	<ul>
		* Bytecode interpreter: (Paolo is working on this).

		* Simple JIT: Not implemented yet (Miguel is
		  researching the code-generator generator)

		* Garbage collection engine (Dick is working on this, his contact is <a

	</ul>
