* Project Status

	
	Pieces of Mono that have been implemented:

	<ul>
		* C# compiler: The C# parser is pretty much complete,
		it generates a parse tree and now semantic analysis and a few
		compiler lever optimizations need to be implemented as well as
		code generation.

		* Metadata library: can currently parse and load
		information from .NET modules (executables and DLL
		files).  It has a few bugs outstanding (table
		dimension computation is incorrect).

		Parsing of Exception tables is missing. 

		It lacks Token to (Table, Index) mapping, but should
		be trivial to write. 

		* Disassembler: Can disassemble .NET modules;  It is
		lacking Exception handling as well as useful debugging
		tools (hex dumping, token dumping).

		* Class Libraries: Only a few classes have been
		implemented. 
	</ul>

	Tasks on the critical path that we are actively working on:

	<ul>
		* Method and Field resolution.

		* Bytecode interpreter: Not implemented yet.

		* Simple JIT: Not implemented yet.

		* Garbage collection engine.
	</ul>
