* Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame

Without the help, the skills and the time of many passionate developers outside of 
the Ximian Mono team, Mono would not be where it is today.

Many of them do it for fun, some do it because they really want a nice CLR they 
can hack on, some do it because they need a working solution to some development 
issues and mono is the ideal tool for the job. 

Some of them may start contributing because they want a mention in the
<b>Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</b>! Whatever the cause, join us in a big<br>
<h1 align="center">Thank you!</h1>

** Nick Drochak

The first, deserved, entry in the <b>Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</b> is for
Nick Drochak, who joined us in the first days of Mono and built the testing 
infrastructure for the C# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured 
himself in the lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping
Mono on the right track through the daily changes in the codebase.
