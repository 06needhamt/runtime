	<a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a> announced the
	launch of the Mono project, an effort to create an Open Source
	implementation of the .NET Development Framework.  

	Mono includes: <a href="c-sharp.html">a compiler</a> for the
	C# language, a <a href="runtime.html">runtime</a> for the
	Common Language Infrastructure and a set of <a
	href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>

	You can read our <a href="rationale.html">rationale</a> for
	this project.  If you have questions about the project, please
	read our list of <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked
	Questions</a> or <a href="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com">contact us.</a>

	Mike Kestner's Gtk# (Gtk-sharp) was checked into the CVS
	repository.  Gtk# can run a simple hello world application.
	The binding is nice, as it maps Gtk+ signals to delegates in
	C#.  You can see the Gtk# Hello World program <a href="src/HelloWorld.cs">here</a>

	Gtk-sharp should be available on the next snapshot set.

	Dietmar checked into CVS the `monoburg' architecture
	independent instruction selector for the JIT engine.

	<b>.NET Hello World is working under Mono!</b>  The latest snapshots
	will let you run it.   

	Hello World consits of 1821 CIL instructions,
