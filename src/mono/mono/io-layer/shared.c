/*
 * Code to support inter-process sharing of handles.
 *
 * I thought of using an mmap()ed file for this.  If linuxthreads
 * supported PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED I would have done; however without
 * that pthread support the only other inter-process IPC
 * synchronisation option is a sysV semaphore, and if I'm going to use
 * that I may as well take advantage of sysV shared memory too.
 * Actually, semaphores seem to be buggy, or I was using them
 * incorrectly :-).  I've replaced the sysV semaphore with a shared
 * integer controlled with Interlocked functions.

 * mmap() files have the advantage of avoiding namespace collisions,
 * but have the disadvantage of needing cleaning up, and also msync().
 * sysV shared memory has a really stupid way of getting random key
 * IDs, which can lead to collisions.
 *
 * I deliberately don't ever delete the shared memory: I'd like to
 * have been able to set the shared memory segment to destroy itself
 * on last close, but it doesn't support that. (Setting IPC_RMID on a
 * segment causes subsequent shmat() with the same key to get a new
 * segment :-( ).  The function to delete the shared memory segment is
 * only called from a debugging tool (mono/handles/shmdel).
 *
 * w32 processes do not have the POSIX parent-child relationship, so a
 * process handle is available to any other process to find out exit
 * status.  Handles are destroyed when the last reference to them is
 * closed.  New handles can be created for long lasting items such as
 * processes or threads, and also for named synchronisation objects so
 * long as these haven't been deleted by having the last referencing
 * handle closed.
