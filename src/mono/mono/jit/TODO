* exceptions: handle exceptions inside unmanaged code
* exceptions: save/restore floating point state
* implementet all floating point instruction in x86.brg, we also need to check
  the floating branch instruction - some of them seems to be wrong, we need to
  write better tests for that.
* implement exceptions
* correctly align value types on the stack and in arrays
* enum types can have several base types (not only int32)
* document the functions and variables in the JIT 
* implement a register set for FP registers (just count register usage on x86)
