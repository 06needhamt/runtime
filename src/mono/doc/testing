* Testing 

	All classes in Mono libraries should have comprehensive unit test
	suites to go with them. Unit testing is a software engineering
  	methodology that makes it easier to build correct code. Every
  	method in every class should have a set of tests to verify
  	they work correctly. Mono also needs a testing framework to
  	make it easy to write and run lots of tests. <a
  	href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>
	and its spinoffs (collectively, <a
  	href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">XUnit</a>)
	are a well designed framework for building unit
  	tests. Implementing JUnit in Mono is a first priority.

	Why do unit testing? It becomes simple to run automated tests
	for the whole library. Unit tests are a safety net - you can
	change part of the code and verify that you haven't broken
	anything. Ideally, tests are written before the actual library
	code itself. And every time a bug is discovered, a test should
	be written to demonstrate the bug, fix the bug, and then if
	you ever reintroduce the bug you will know immediately. For
