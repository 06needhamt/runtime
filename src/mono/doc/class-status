* Status of the various pieces of the class library

	You can browse the status of the class library and see who has
	registered to work on what parts of the system.  These list
	work-in-progress components currently.

	<ul>
		* Per <a href="class-status/per-assembly.html">Assembly</a>

		* Per <a href="class-status/per-completion.html">Completion</a>

		* Per <a href="class-status/per-maintainer.html">Maintainer</a>

		* Per <a href="class-status/per-unimplemented.html">Unimplemented</a>
	</ul>

	A better mechanism will soon be in place, I just did this
	really quickly, as we already got one duplicated implementation.

	You can also download the XML <a
	href="class-status/maintainers.xml">maintainers</a> file that
	contains the actual maintainers list.  

	I am sure we can generate better reports, if you are
	interested in contributing, let <a
	href="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">me</a> know.
