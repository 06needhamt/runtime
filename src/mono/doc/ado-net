* ADO.NET

	The coordinator for the ADO.NET implementation is <a
	href="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">Rodrigo Moya</a>.  

* Action plan

	The current plan to implement ADO.NET is as follows:

	<b>Step 1:</b> SqlClient:

	<ul>
		* Implementation of System.Data.SqlClient based on
		  the PostgreSQL C API.

		* Once the System.Data.SqlClient code is functional and
		  is usable by other people, we willl move it to
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL, and will convert the existing
		  System.Data.SqlClient to be just a wrapper around
		  System.Data.PostgreSQL.  

	</ul>

	<b>Step 2:</b> OleDBClient:
	<ul>
		* On Unix systems: OleDBClient will use LibGDA as its
		  engine. 

		  LibGDA is the "engine" that is used by
		  Gnome-Db (only libgda, not libgnomedb at all).

		* On Windows systems: OleDBClient We will use OleDB as
		  its engine.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 3:</b> SqlClient Providers:

	<ul>
		* System.Data.SqlClient will then become a generic
		  proxy for binding to other SQL implementations other
		  than Postgress (MySQL on Unix/Windows; MS SQL on
		  Window; Interbase on Unix/Windows). 
	</ul>
