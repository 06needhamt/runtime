* Microsoft Hailstorm and Passport

	Microsoft Passport is a centralized database hosted by
	Microsoft that enhances the consumer experience with the Web
	by providing a single logon system that they can use across a
	number of participant web sites.

	As you might know by now from our extensive <a
	href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, the Mono project has nothing to do
	with Microsoft Hailstorm or <a
	href="http://www.passport.com">Microsoft Passport.</a>

	Still a lot of people have asked us our opinion on them.

** Passport

	There is nothing in Passport really advanced technologically
	speaking.
