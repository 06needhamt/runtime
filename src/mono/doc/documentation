* Documentation

	Although most of the concepts from Microsoft.NET can
	be applied to the completed Mono platform, we do need to
	have a complete set of free documentation written specifically
	for Mono.

	The documentation license we have chosen is the GNU Free
	Documentation License (FDL), the standard for most documents
	in the free software world. 

	We need documentation on a number of topics:

	<ul>

		* The development tools (compilers, assembler tools,
		  language reference, design time features).

		* Frequently Asked Question compilations.

		* HOWTO documents.

		* The Class Libraries

		* Tutorials on Mono and the specifics of running it. 

		* A guide to Mono as compared to the Microsoft.NET
		  Framework SDK

	</ul>

** Class Library documentation

	We are moving to a new setup for documenting the class libraries, 
	you can read about it <a href="classlib-doc.html">here</a>
