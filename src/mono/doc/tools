* Tools

	We need a number of tools to make people productive using a
	Mono-based solution.  Some of these tools can be developed on
	Windows before Mono is fully finished.

** Integrated Development Environment

	There is already a project to create a C# development
	environment (SharpDevelop).  People could work with the
	SharpDevelop hackers to produce a unified development environment.

** Help Browser

	We need a good help browser that can be used to browse all the
	Mono documentation.
