* Debugging information

	Compile your programs using the `-g' flag in MCS, that will generate a file
	with the extension .dbg containing the dwarf symbols for your executable.

	To get stack traces with line number information, you need to run your 
	program like this:

	<b>
	mono --debug program.exe
	</b>

	Notice that the program will need to be compiled with the -g
	flag and that running with --debug will slow down the execution.

* Mono Debugger 

	A new debugger has been created in C# and using Gtk# for its
	user interface, this will simplify the debugging of CLI applications.

	Stay turned for its first public release.
