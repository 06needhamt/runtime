* Compilers for other languages

	Here are some other free compilers for other languages that
	target .NET and should work with Mono with no problem:

	<ul>
		* <a href="#ComponentPascal">Component Pascal</a>
		* <a href="#MonoLogo">MonoLogo</a>
		* <a href="#Oberon">Oberon</a>
	</ul>

	Languages we would like to have supported, with links to resources:

	<ul>
		* <a href="#JavaScript">Java Script</a>
		* <a href="java.html">Java</a>
		* <a href="#c">C</a>
	</ul>

<a name="MonoLogo">
** MonoLogo

	An implementation of Logo for Mono (and .NET)

	The <A href="http://monologo.sf.net">Mono Logo</a> compiler is
	hosted in the <a href="ccvs.html">Mono CVS</a> repository
	and also available on the <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> mirrors.

<a name="Oberon">
** Oberon

	This Oberon compiler is written in Oberon.NET (another self
	hosting compiler):

<a name="ComponentPascal">
** Component Pascal

	The Component Pascal compiler: <a

* Missing languages

	Here is a list of a few languages that we would like to see
	supported.  We will try to maintain a set of links here with 
	technical information for those interested in porting,
	implementing or adapting a compiler for any of these
	languages:

<a name="JavaScript">
* Java Script

	The Mozilla project has an implementation of JavaScript
	written in Java called <a
	href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>.

	You could port this code from Java to C#.

	Note that since JavaScript allows for evaluation at runtime,
	the compiler has to be built as a class that can be invoked at
	runtime.

<a name="c">
* C

	Ideally GCC could be modified to generate CIL, but it is a 
	big task.  That would give us various compilers in one pass.

	Rumor is that the next version of the LCC compiler will
	include an IL backend.  We do not know how extensive the support
	for integration with .NET will be, but it would be an interesting
	excercise to add an extension to C to call into .NET code.

	LCC is not an open source compiler, but it is free as long as you
	do not profit from selling it. 

<a name="Java">
* Java

	We have a <a href="java.html">separate page</a> for Java.
