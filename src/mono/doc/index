** Feb 11, 2002

	We would like to welcome all the new developers that have
	joined the project in the last couple of days.  The classes
	are rapidly moving.

	An explanation of the relationship between <a
	href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-hackers/2002-February/msg00031.html">GNOME
	and Mono</a>.  

	Nick is still leading our test suite platform.  I can not
	stress how important it is to have a good regression test suite
	for our platform, as buggy class libraries are what are
	stopping the compiler from running completely on Linux.

	We are of course psyched to see Mono run on
	non-Linux systems.  Work is moving on native code generation
	for StrongARM, PowerPC, and SPARC as well as porting Mono to
	other systems.

	There are a couple of debates on the Mono list on implementing
	a set of web server classes for <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-February/002911.html">enabling
	ASP.NET</a> on Mono.

	Paolo also <a

	posted a list of pending tasks</a> to enable the compiler to run on Linux

** Jan 29, 2002

	Dan Lewis has contributed a major missing set of classes to
	Mono: <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-January/002745.html">
	System.Text.RegularExpressions</a>.

	This is a fully .NET compatible implementation of the .NET regular expressions,
	fully Unicode aware.  This contribution is very appreciated, as implementing this
	was not entirely trivial (supporting Unicode, plus a regex engine which is a super
	set of the Perl regex engine).

	The Mono contributors have relicensed the Class Libraries under

** Jan 21, 2002

	Dick has got a simple web server running with Mono (`MIS: Mono
	Internet Server') that is mostly used to test our IO layer, a
	<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/dick-mis-server.png">screenshot</a>

	Paolo and Dietmar are busy making our runtime self sufficient on 
	non-Windows platforms.  

	C# compiler front:  A lot of focus in the past weeks after
	the C# became self hosting has been in making the compiler a useful
	tool for development: improve error handling, provide better error
	reports, fixing all known bugs, and finally profiling of the compiler
	has begun.

** Jan 8, 2002

	Our compiler has been self-supporting since January 3rd.  In
	the meantime, we have been busy working on making it run on
	Linux.  Today Paolo got more work done on Reflection.Emit and
	the compiler compiled `console.cs' (a sample Mono program) on
	Linux.

** Jan 4, 2002

	Dietmar landed the Unicode support patch.  Class libraries and
	runtimes are now fully Unicode aware.  The details are <a href=
	"http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-January/002409.html">
	here</a>

	Last minute breaking news: Paolo got our compiler in Linux to
	compile fib.cs, patches are comming tomorrow once we have
	ChangeLog entries.   

** Jan 4, 2002

	Mike Kestner posted an update on Gtk# <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2002-January/000021.html"><i>New
	year, new direction</i></a>.

	Gtk# will be our foundation on which we will be implementing
	System.Windows.Forms.  

** Jan 3, 2002

	Mono C# compiler becomes self-sufficient.  We can now continue
	development of the compiler with itself.  

	Work on the class libraries is still underway for having a full
	self hosting system.  We hope to achieve our goal of self-hosting
	on Linux before the end of the month.

	Join the fun by downloading either tonight's <a
	href="snapshots">snapshot</a> or getting your sources from our
	<a href="anoncvs.html">Anonymous CVS server</a>.

** Dec 28, 2001

	After a lot of work, the C# compiler can compile itself.
	There are still errors in the generated image, but they are
	being fixed quickly.

	We will soon have the first non-Microsoft C# implementation!

** Dec 18, 2001

	JIT: More work on our IO abstraction layer (Dick). 

	JIT: exception handling for unmanaged code (Dietmar)

	System.Reflection: Support for PropertyInfo and
	PropertyBuilder as well as the various queries for MethodBase.

	C#: Pre-processor; Rewrite of MemberLookup which fixed many of
	the outstanding issues.  More bug fixing allows it to compile
	more programs.

** Dec 14, 2001

	Dietmar has improved the register allocation and now Mono performs
	two to three times as fast as it did yesterday.  Amazing.

	The compiler keeps moving along, explicit interface
	implementation is there.

** Dec 11, 2001

	The JIT engine can now run all the compiler regression tests as 
	well as assorted other programs, many more opcodes added
	recently.  Currently the JIT engine uses a very simplistic register
	allocator (just enough to allow us to focus on feature completeness)
	and that will be the next major task to improve performance and
	reduce spills and reloads. 

	On the C# compiler front: language features are now pretty
	much complete.  The big missing tasks are unsafe code support,
	visibility, explicit interface implementation plus static flow
	analysis.  There are many small bugs that need to be addressed.

	You can get your copy of the <a href="snapshots">latest Mono</a>

	More work is also required on fixing the foundation class
	libraries, it is easy to find spots now since Nick got the
	`make test' going.

** Dec 1, 2001

	AnonCVS access to Mono is here (updated every hour).  Thanks
	to <a href="http://www.hispalinux.es">HispaLinux</a> and Jesus
	Climent for helping to set this up.

** Nov 30, 2001

	All tests from the mono runtime work with the JIT engine now
	(Dietmar).

	Recursive enumeration definition in the C# compiler are
	working now (Ravi).

	More work on the Web classes (Gaurav).

** Nov 28, 2001

	JIT land: Paolo got GDB support into the JIT engine while
	Dietmar added exceptions support to it.

	The C# compiler supports all array initializations now, and the
	switch statement as well as fixing many existing bugs.  Many
	new more tests.
	
	Nick keeps working on improving our class library test suite.

	Dick has almost completed the Mono IO layer.

	Mike Kestner has posted an <a

	on Gtk# development.
</blockquote>

** Nov 14, 2001

<blockquote>
	Paolo today got the Mono C# compiler running <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2001-November/001941.html">on
	Linux</a>.  It compiles a sample program and then the sample
	program is executed.

	Mutator unary operators (++ and --) in the compiler are fully
	functional, they used to only work on variables, and now they
	are complete.

	To sum things up: The Mono C# compiler is written in C# and
	uses the .NET classes to get its work done.  To make this work
	on Linux work has to happen in various fronts:
<ul>
		* The C# compiler is being worked on and can compile
		  many programs now (our test suite at this point is 
		  made up of 40 tests).

		* The class libraries need to be mature enough to support
		  the compiler, particularly System.Reflection.Emit (which is 
		  what Paolo has been working on lately). 

	  	  The compiler currently requires 103 classes from the
		  .NET runtime (you can get the list by running: <b>monodis --typeref mcs.exe</b>

		* The interpreter should be mature enough to run the actual
		  compiler byte codes and the corlib bytecodes.
</ul>

	At the same time, Dietmar is working on the JIT engine which will
	replace our interpreter in production.

** Nov 12, 2001

<blockquote>
	Dietmar got value types working on the JIT engine.  Sean has

	Ravi commited the initial support for Attributes in the
	compiler. 

	Many HTML Controls from Leen checked into CVS.

	Paolo checked in his new System.Reflection and
	System.Reflection.Emit implementations.  He has been working
	steadily on this huge task for a few weeks now.  This is the
	foundation for the Mono C# compiler, and hence a very

	new controls plus improved and bug fixed base classes).

<blockquote>
	Lots of classes for System.Web from Gaurav were commited this
	morning.

	Some large recent developments:

	The Decimal implementation from Martin Weindel has been
	partially integrated (we need to put the internalcalls in
	place now and compile and link the decimal code).

	Derek Holden commited recently the IntegerFormatter code into
	the CVS, so we got a pretty comprehensive integer formatting
	engine that we can finally use all over the place. 

	Compiler got support for lock as well as assorted bug fixes.
	Ravi is still working on array support (and then we can
	optimize foreach for the array case).   

	Dietmar is busy working on flow analysis on the JITer, the
	previous mechanism of generating the forest was wrong.  Paolo
	has been a busy bee reworking the System.Reflection.Emit
	support code, and we should have some pretty nice stuff next
	week.  Dick on the other hand is still working on the
	WaitOne/WaitAll emulation code.  WaitAll is like select on
	steroids: it can wait for different kinds of objects: files,
	mutexes, events and a couple of others.

	Mike Kestner is busy working on Gtk# which is now using the
	.defs files to quickly wrap the API.
