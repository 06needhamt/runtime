	<a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a> announced the
	launch of the Mono project, an effort to create an Open Source
	implementation of the .NET Development Framework.  

	Mono includes: <a href="c-sharp.html">a compiler</a> for the
	C# language, a <a href="runtime.html">runtime</a> for the
	Common Language Infrastructure and a set of <a
	href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>

	You can read our <a href="rationale.html">rationale</a> for
	this project.  If you have questions about the project, please
	read our list of <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked
	Questions</a> or <a href="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com">contact us.</a>

	You might also want to <a href="download.html">Download the
	source</a> for our work so far.  Or you can grab a <a

	JIT engine supports many of the object constructs now (object
	creation, vtable setup, interface table setup).  

	The C# compiler now has almost full property support (only
	missing bit are pre-post increment/decrement operations),
	delegates are now created (still missing delegate invocation).
	try/catch/finally is also supported in the compiler now.

	System.Decimal implementation is in, as well as many crypto
	classes.

	Sergey has released his first version of the <b>ilasm</b>
	assembler written in C#.  You can get it from his web page:
	<a
	href="http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua">http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua</a>.

	The plan is to integrate ildasm into the Mono CVS soon.  This
	component should in theory also be reusable for SharpDevelop
	eventually.

** Oct 4, 2001

	Our System.Reflection.Emit implementation created its first
	executable today.  This means that a very simple .NET program
	that was compiled on Windows was able to generate a .NET program
	while running on Linux using the Mono runtime.

	The various piece of the puzzle are starting to get together:
	the compiler can compile simple programs now and we are
	basically focusing on completeness now.

	<a
	href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/default.asp">Sharp
	Develop 0.80</a> was released today.

** Sep 26, 2001

	More progress: more opcodes are working (Paolo); The compiler
	runs up to a point in Mint (Paolo); operator overloading works
	(both unary and binary) all over the place (Miguel); Completed decimal
	type conversions (Miguel); New build system in place based on
	Ant (Sean and Sergey);  Refactored and documented the
	internals of the JIT engine (Dietmar);  StatementExpressions
	handled correctly (Miguel).

** Sep 21, 2001

	A couple of news-worthy items: Dick got the initial thread
	support into mint; Paolo implemented many new opcodes; Dietmar
	got long operations and mul/div working on the JITer; Ravi rewrote
	the Method selector for expressions to be conformant; Miguel
	got i++ working.   All in tonight's snapshot

	Paolo has written a section on <a href="porting.html">Porting
	Mono</a> to othre architectures.

	<A a href="download.html#sep-18">Mono 0.7</a> has been
	released (runtime engine, class libraries
	and C# compiler).  Check the <a href="archive/mono-0.7">Mono
	0.7 announcement</a> for details

	Mike Kestner's Gtk# (Gtk-sharp) was checked into the CVS
	repository.  Gtk# can run a simple hello world application.
	The binding is nice, as it maps Gtk+ signals to delegates in
	C#.  You can see the Gtk# Hello World program <a href="src/HelloWorld.cs">here</a>

	Gtk-sharp should be available on the next snapshot set.

** Sep 10, 2001

	Dietmar checked in his CIL tree/forest regeneration and most
	importantly, the x86 instruction selector burg grammar.


** Sep 5, 2001

	The MCS compiler <b>can compile the sample Hello World</b>
	application and generate a Windows/CIL executable that runs!

	This executable runs with the Mono Interpreter of course (see
	August 28)

** Sep 4, 2001

	Dietmar checked into CVS the `monoburg' architecture
	independent instruction selector for the JIT engine.

** Aug 28, 2001

	<b>.NET Hello World is working under Mono!</b>  The latest snapshots
	will let you run it.   

	Hello World consits of 1821 CIL instructions, 
        performs 66 subroutine calls and loads 12 classes from the corlib.dll

	Good work Mono team!
