* Java

	It would be interesting to support the Java language as part
	of the Mono project.  

	You have to think of Java as various pieces: Java the
	language and Java the virtual machine.  

	It is possible to compile Java to .NET, as shown by the
	Microsoft J# compiler.   We could then allow the migration of
	Java applications to the Mono runtime. 

** The translator.

	It would be interesting to write a semantic translator that
	converts java byte codes into CIL opcodes.  This is possible
	because the Java byte codes are a subset of the CIL ones.

	A semantic tree needs to be constructed (very much in the
	spirit of what is done in mono_analize_stack in
	<tt>mono/mono/jit/jit.c</tt>.  Once such a semantic tree is
	constructed, we could generate the equivalent Java code.

	This has a number of interesting side effects: people can
	continue to use their existing Java compilers to compile their
	code, and a simple tool that converts their .class files into
	a .NET assembly can be used.

** Libraries

	We could translate the GNU Classpath libraries with the above
	tools to provide the Java runtime required to host into the
	Mono runtime.  Some special treatment would be required for
	core data types like integers, arrays and strings, and of
	course reuse where possible existing classes from .NET to make
	them compatible.
