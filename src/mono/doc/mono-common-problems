Getting it:

	There are several ways to get Mono running on your computer. 
	Although the purpose of this document I will add some info 
	here for completness. After all you need the software if you
	want to get in trouble :).

	RPMs or DEBs can be found at Baselabs <a href="http://mono.baselabs.org/index.php/software">http://mono.baselabs.org/index.php/software</a>.

	See <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download">http://www.go-mono.com/download</a> for more information.

Installing it:

	Here comes the real fun. This is what some people have claimed for as
	a 'foolproff way to get started'.

	First, assume you have the packages.
	You must know that:

		1.- Mono can be compiled in Linux and Windows but mcs
		    cannot. Please don't write to the list telling that
		    you have downloaded the mcs-X.XX.tar.gz and that 
		    you can't build it. It's a 'status' problem. The 
		    mcs compiler can't be compiled under Linux yet.
		    This means, entering in mcs-X.XX and running 'make'
		    will show you something as:
			
			[jaime@localhost mcs-0.12]$ make
			for i in jay nant mcs class nunit tools; do 					
			\	(cd $i; make linux) || exit 1;	\
			done
			make[1]: Cambiando a directorio `/home/jaime/utils/mcs-0.12/jay'
			make[1]: No se hace nada para `linux'.
			make[1]: Saliendo directorio `/home/jaime/utils/mcs-0.12/jay'
			make[1]: Cambiando a directorio `/home/jaime/utils/mcs-0.12/nant'
			csc /out:NAnt.exe /recurse:*.cs 
			/bin/sh: csc: command not found
			make[1]: *** [NAnt.exe] Error 127
			make[1]: Saliendo directorio `/home/jaime/utils/mcs-0.12/nant'
			make: *** [linux] Error 1


                2.- You need to get the packages refered in the Mono 
		    download page. These are: glib 1.3, pkgconfig...

	Second, read all the READMEs and INSTALLs. 

		For short, you will normally will be able to install the RPMs and DEBs as
		usual:

			rpm -Uhv mono-X.XX_baselabs-XXXXXXXX.rpm

		See the BaseLabs page for a full explanation. 

		Building your own binaries it's easy too!. 
		Unzip and untar the tarball (will work only for Mono, remember!!)
		
			tar -zxvf mono-X.XX.tar.gz 

		Enter the directory where the sources reside:

			cd mono-X.XX

		Run the configure script:

			./configure.in

		Then make the package:

			make

		Now you are able to install it:

			make install

	Remember once again. mcs cannot be compiled under Linux. You need a Windows system
	where to build it. The only way for you to get the mcs in Linux without building
	it by your own in a Windows machine (including the VMWare alternative) is to install
	the binaries from the BaseLabs page. It's also important to say that there are 
	NUnit packages too in that site but that you probably won't need to care about that
	if you are reading this document.

Running it:

	If you want to compile a little program using the mcs, let's say "konnichiwa.cs" 
	do this:

		mcs konnichiwa.cs

	The output will depend on wether your program is compilable or not, if it is a
	"RESULT: 0" will be printed in your gnome-terminal (or whatever 'console' you use).
	You should see a file called "konnichiwa.exe" in the same directory (folder) where
	the source (konnichiwa.cs) is.

	To run the binary you have to options. The most used is:

		mono konnichiwa.exe

	but it might be better to use this other approach instead (calling the interpreter):

		mint konnichiwa.exe

	That's it. The Mono mcs compiler allows you to perform more complicated compilations
	and I will show an example using three source files. Suppose you have three files:
	person.cs, employee.cs, Test.cs. The first one could contain an abstract class Person
	while the second one could be the source for a concrete class derived from Person and
	called Employee. The last one, Test.cs could be a simple class to show how the classes
	work and it contains an entry point (the Main() method, signed with the appropiate 
	attributes 'public static' and the correct type 'void'). Then you could get the 
	Text.exe program by calling: 

		mcs Test.cs person.cs employee.cs

	CSharp I am preparing to teach at the University of Granada, Spain. If you are a newbie
	HTH. 
	
A note about problems:

	First see the <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">Ximian Bugzilla</a> page in order 
	to get know if the bug has already been reported.

	Second, read this document. 

	Third, visit the mono mailing lists' archives and do a little research in there for
	threads talking about the problems you are having.

	Fourth if you still cannot override the problem, contact the lists.

Known problems:   	

	1.- mcs fails to compile in Linux. 

		sol. mcs cannot compile in Linux. Try to install the already made packages 
			from http://mono.baselabs.org/index.php/software

	2.- mono fails to compile in my Linux box.

		sol. Uhg... a generic 'question'. Proceed as above.  (note for geeks: GOTO: 1.-)

	3.- I cannot install mono under RedHat 7.3.

		sol. Try to upgrade your libc6 packages. In general, check that you have the 
			right versions for the packages glib, pkgconfig, libc...

	4.- I cannot compile mcs nor mono under Windows. Are you fooling me?.

		sol. No, we are not. Have you read carefully the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">download</a> 
			page?. You need CygWin among other things. Check all of that before 
			trying to compile.
