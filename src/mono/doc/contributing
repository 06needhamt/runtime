* Contributing to the Mono project

	There are many ways in which you can help in the Mono project:

	<ul>
		* <b>Programmers:</b> You can work on a free
		  implementation of the <a
		  href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>, the
		  <a href="runtime.html">runtime engine</a>, <a
		  href="tools.html">the tools</a>, the <a
		  href="testing.html">testing framework</a>

		* <b>Writers:</b> You can help us with writing <a
		  href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.
		
	</ul>

* Special note

	If you have looked at Microsoft's implementation of .NET or
	their shared source code, you will not be able to contribute
	to Mono.

	Please, follow care when reading code
